All Google Sheets Formulas
Please see Google Sheets documentation for more information.

DISCLAIMER:
These formula examples skip some constructors. 

MODE: "=MODE(FILTER(E2:E10000,B2:B10000=449))"
EXPLANATION:
  - MODE is the most common number taken. The parameters require WHICH CELL
    to take.
  - CONSTRUCTOR: Defined cells. Example: =MODE(cell)

FILTER: "=FILTER(E2:10000,B2:100000=449))"
EXPLAINATION:
  - FILTER screens out certain data based on criteria
  - CONSTURCTORS : FILTER(What set of data do you want?, Based on what criteria?)
  - In this case, we want data in cells E2 through E10000. We do not put column
    E because Google sheets is not able to take that request.
  - We also want to filter based on team number (in this case 449). The team
    numbers are in column B.

PERCENTILE: "=PERCENTILE(FILTER(E2:E10000,B2:B10000=449),0.9)"
EXPLANATION:
  - PERCENTILE gives the data at a certain defined percentile.
  - For example, if I had a class of 20 students, and I want to know what is the
    90th percentile (.9) of the class.
  - CONSTRUCTORS: PERCENTILE(Defined cells, defined percentile).
  - In this case, we want cells E2:1000, based on the fact that team 449 scored
    them. (See Filter for more info).
  - We want to see how they can do based 90% of their percentiles. Meaning,
    how well they can do at the top 10% of their time.

PERCENTILE RANK (Derived from PERCENTILE):
"=PERCENTRANK(FILTER(E2:E10000,B2:B10000=449), MODE(FILTER(E2:E10000,B2:B10000=449)))"
EXPLANATION:
  - PERCENTILE RANK gives the number of the times something pops up. For example
    if I have a data set of (0,0,0,0,0,1).
  - The result would be 5/6. The MODE is 0 (5 numbers) out of 6 numbers.
  - CONSTRUCTORS: =PERCENTRANK(FILTER(E2:E10000,B2:B10000=449), MODE(FILTER(E2:E10000,B2:B10000=449)))
  - PERCENTRANK(DATA RANGE, WHAT DATA TO LOOK FOR)
  - In this case, we want to find the number of times something pops up (MODE,
    see MODE for more info), out of a certain data range (see FILTER).
  - Number of times the MODE or a particular data set appears
